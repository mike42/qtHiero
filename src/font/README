This script will substitute the default glyphs in Wikihiero with its own,
generated from a local copy of Aegyptus313.ttf.

Before running it, you need the following packages:
	fontforge imagemagick ttf-ancient-fonts optipng

The script consumes a large amount of disk space (allow 500MB), and will take
several hours to complete on common hardware.

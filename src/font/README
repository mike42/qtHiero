This script will substitute the default glyphs in Wikihiero with its own,
generated from a local copy of Aegyptus313.ttf.

Before running it, you need the following packages:
	fontforge imagemagick ttf-ancient-fonts optipng

The script consumes a large amount of disk space (allow 200MB), and will take
about an hour to complete on common hardware.

To return to stock glyphs, go to vendor/wikihiero and type:
    git stash

And to re-generate glyphs after this, you will need to use:
    make clean-original
    make clean-small
    make
